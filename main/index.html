 <p>1) Rocket Equation</p>
 <p>A rocket is a propulsive device that produces a thrust force F on a vehicle by ejecting 
mass a high relative velocity c. This force is simply equal to the rate of momentum 
outflow from a control volume that encloses the vehicle. If m! is the mass expulsion rate, 
we then find</p>

  <p>This is a particularly useful result because c and m are insensitive to the operating 
environment of the rocket. In more detail, c is not necessarily the velocity of the expelled 
mass as it leaves the rocket’s exit plane, because the pressure field may continue 
accelerating this mass for some distance. In that case, c represents the limiting “far field” 
velocity of the ejected mass. </p>
