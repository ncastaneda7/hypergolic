 <p>Lecture 1 - Rocket Equation; Gravity Loss; Optimum Acceleration</p>
 <p>1) Rocket Equation </p>
  
 <p>A rocket is a propulsive device that produces a thrust force \(F\) on a vehicle by ejecting 
mass a high relative velocity \(c\). This force is simply equal to the rate of momentum 
outflow from a control volume that encloses the vehicle. If \( \dot{m} \) is the mass expulsion rate, 
we then find \[ F = \dot{m}c \] </p>
   <p>This is a particularly useful result because \(c\) and \( \dot{m}\) are insensitive to the operating 
environment of the rocket. In more detail, \(c\) is not necessarily the velocity of the expelled 
mass as it leaves the rocket’s exit plane, because the pressure field may continue 
accelerating this mass for some distance. In that case, \(c\) represents the limiting “far field” 
velocity of the ejected mass. </p>

 <p>For a rocket-powered vehicle in a vertical launch from the Earth,
  \[ m\frac{dv}{dt}=-c\frac{dm}{dt}-mg \to dv=-c\frac{dm}{m}-gdt \]
 \[ v = -\int_0^t \mathrm c(h) \frac{dm}{m} - \int_0^t g(h)dt; \h=\int_0^t vdt \]</p>
  
 
 <p>As indicated, both \(c\) and \(g\) are functions of \(h\). In the case of \(c\), the dependence is through 
the atmospheric pressure, \(p_0\), an effect we will explore in detail later. The atmospheric 
pressure varies with weather and with temperature, but a rule of thumb is:
 \[ \frac{p_0}{p_0(r_E)}=e^-\frac{r-r_E}{6.68}r-r_E=km\]</p>

 <p>In fact the pressure variation is much more important in the context of aircraft engines, 
whose thrust is essentially proportional to the atmospheric density, other factors being 
equal. </p>

 <p>The gravitational attraction varies as \(g(r) = g_E (r_E/r)^2 \) , where \(r_E\) is the Earth's radius, \(r =
r_E + h\) and \(g_E\) is the gravitational acceleration at the Earth’s surface. Since rockets 
typically operate for a short time only, \(g\) may be taken here as a constant to a good 
approximation.</p>

 <p>If as a first approximation we take c and g constant we can integrate the rocket equation 
to get: \[ v-v_0 = -c\ln\frac{m(t)}{m_0}-gt \] and this is the usual form of the Rocket Equation. Remember that it applies to a vertical 
launch. For other flight paths the last term changes. Also remember that we have 
neglected atmospheric drag forces (this last approximation is valid for large rockets, but 
may not be for smaller vehicles, which have more area per unit volume). </p>

  <p>2) Gravity Loss & Optimum Acceleration</p>
  
  <p>As we will see, it is helpful to express this relation as one for the mass ratio in 
terms of the velocity change, since it is the latter that is set by the mission, e.g. launch to 
LEO. But this leaves gt to be determined. If we make the additional assumption that \(\dot{m}\)
    = constant, then \[ m_0-m(t)=\dot{m}t=\frac{F}{c}t=\frac{m_0a_0}{c}t \] where \(a_0\) is the “initial acceleration”, defined as the thrust divided by the initial mass. 
Note that \(a_0>g\) for achieving takeoff.</p>
