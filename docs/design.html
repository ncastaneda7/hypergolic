<h1>Why?</h1>
<p> I want to learn how to design rocket engines, and the best way to achieve this is 
    by just doing it. I'm not a propulsion engineer, yet. </p>

<h1>Worse = Best</h1>
<p> 1) My goal is to understand the basic principles and applications in the
    context of a propulsion system, and designing components in isolation will not 
    provide this knowledge, therefore arriving to a complete design > best design. 
    To achieve this I'll need to make many assumptions and simplifications to get to a
     design quicker, regardless of how "good" or "bad" it'll be (with some common sense 
    obviously - I don't want things melting or breaking).

<p> 2) Since I've never done this before I'm giving myself permission to fail. It's 
    performance might the "worse", but I'll strive for the engineering and 
    science behind the design will be as realistic as possible, and the "best" I can do
    as my first time doing this. I think about this like a sandbox to play and explore.
